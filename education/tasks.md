1.	Difficult to find the related ideas
One of your client's teams has many ideas about the product they're making. You've created the backlog where they can put these ideas with a special tag.

But on discussion meetings, it's difficult to evaluate them as they are corresponding with different parts of the product. It would be more convenient to discuss all ideas firstly for one part of the product, then for the second and so on.

Also, sometimes discussions about these parts of the product are lost after meetings.

3.	The team wants to add a SMART description for the tasks
While working with the team developing the product you've noticed the completed tasks often return to working again, especially after team demonstration meetings. The client confirms the team sometimes done not exactly the work that he meant while task creation. After discussion, you decided to use the SMART template for the tasks.

4.	Async processes between front-end, back-end, and design parts
You have a client's team developing the new mobile application. There're several front-end developers, back-end developers, and designers. Every new feature requires three parts from the team - front-end, back-end, and design. 

After the second week of the app's execution, you've noticed that the process is chaotic, as developers are working on parts for different features. So, after the second week, you have design and front-end for the first feature, back-end for the second one, design for the third, back-end for the fourth, and no done features at all.

How can you synchronize the team to get done features as soon as possible?

5.	The marketing team lost the new completed parts
In your client's team, one part performs some work, the other - makes marketing tasks. They have two different lists in your spaces. Sometimes, after performing tasks are done, the marketing part doesn't know about this new piece of work, as this task is placed in the other list.
