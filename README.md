# Hi there!

My name is Tanya, and I am passionate and experienced **JS-developer and Product Manager**! My first position was a front-end developer, then I was a back-end developer, a business analyst, and finally, I've grown up to product manager. This way provides me with many sides of the product vision owing to combining the technical background and real product development:

- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and Redux, JQuery** aren't the empty sounds for me thanks to my front-end experience. When I became a back-end developer I met **NodeJS, MongoDB, PostgreDB, SQL, RabbitMQ, Bash and Batch scripts**. Of course, I know such common developer tools like **Git, SourceTree, GitLab, NPM, Yarn, Webpack, JIRA, Youtrack, Redmine**.

- One of the most important things in developer life is to write tests properly. Proudly I can say that I am a guru of **Test Driven Development, unit, functional, integration, screenshot testing. Continuous development, continuous integration, release process** - I went through all of this.

- My strong skills are **data presentation and visualization** owing the work on data visualization tools. It helps me to pass all data to developers, managers, sponsors, all stakeholders. One more strong skill is **the deep understanding of Agile methodology and agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban**, because I worked using it as a developer, and like a manager.

- I have a clear understanding of all project stages because I've learned the **PMBOK** carefully. And not only this - I have several certificates from the Coursera where I've learned **Product Management, Digital Marketing, and Business Analysis. To track data and metrics** - one of my common goals last two years, that I successfully did with **MixPanel**.

- I **coordinate** many people and even departments because I always was engaged in almost all processes in the companies. I'm really keen on connecting designer, developers, QA-specialists, managers and customers together. **Requirements, analysis, product vision, strategy** - I make all that is needed to the product development.

- And, of course, **English**, that I am improving every day of my life :)
